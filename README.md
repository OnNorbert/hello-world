# hello-world

Set the goal and you will succeed it.

You can be tops in Australia and be unheard of everywhere else.

You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.

Faith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe.
